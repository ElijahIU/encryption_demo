# Encryption Demo
Simple set of Python files to demonstrate encryption with the `cryptography` library.

`create_keys.py`
Creates a public/private key pair and saves them to files.

`encrypt_message.py`
Encrypts a plain text message with the **public** key and saves the encrypted_message to an external file.

`decrypt_message.py`
Uses the **private** key to *decrypt* the message stored in the external file.
